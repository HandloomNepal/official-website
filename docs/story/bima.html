				<p>Bima started as a weaver, with Monika’s suggestion she became a master dyer which she loves and has a real talent for. Each colour requires a different process. It is a very accurate and technical operation. To consistently produce quality colours is extremely skilful even between shades of the same colour takes attention to detail. Bima says the hardest colours are black and red but her favourite, even though very difficult, is coffee.
Despite her situation and many health issues Bima was determined to build a future for here and her family. Coming from a small village roughly 70km from Pokhara, limited education, as there are no constructed roads, transport is very difficult so it involves much walking. As many Nepalese people do especially men feel that the only to support their family is to work abroad. Bima’s husband had an opportunity to work in the Middle-East. For him to do this, meant taking loans from friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately when he arrived this proved to be a scam that happens to many people from Nepal. He barely made enough money to exist let alone send money for his family or pay loans. It took him 2 years to return to Nepal. Meanwhile Bima was under much stress and obligation to pay the loans and take care of her son. When her husband returned he found work as labourer on a construction site. Bima worked as a cleaner, but both incomes didn’t allow for school fees and general living expenses. </p>
