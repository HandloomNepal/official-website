				<p>Kalpana expertly weaves the threads into magnificent cloths to different specifications in design, colour and lengths ready to be sewn. She is always smiling and has a very happy nature.</p>
<p>Kalpana’s story is not just a story of struggle but also a true love story. Kalpana and her husband originated in Chitwan, an area in southern Nepal. As they are both from different casts, neither of their families agreed to their marriage. This proved to be very difficult. In their first year of marriage they were blessed with a baby boy. Unfortunately, Kalana’s husband was unemployed, both families refused to help due to their marriage disagreement. 
With a 1 one year old they decided to move to Pokhara where her husband, after a few months, found work as a metal worker. As their son approached school age it was apparent that there was not enough income to pay school fees and she wanted to contribute to the family.
kalpana left school at the age of 14 and wasn’t encouraged to stay and at the time she didn’t realise the importance of an education While living in the village all there was to do was wonder around and chat with other women, there was no expectation of leaving the village or any significance on having an education. But when faced with the situation of her own child needing to be educated and couldn’t find productive work, she realised this importance. Now she is an expert weaver she is aspiring to become a weaver.</p>
