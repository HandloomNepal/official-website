## Background of HWSS
Himalayan Women’s Skills Society is a young and
inspiring non-profit organisation born from the need
to help disadvantages women from an array of
backgrounds. The whole project is very proud to be
self-funded. The women have worked tirelessly
towards getting this project off the ground and have
achieved amazing results in a short period of time.


## Products, Handloom Nepal
All products are made from organic materials
including the dye. The highest quality of materials
are used and expertly put together by the women

## Who does the Organisation help?

Many women from the small villages surrounding Pokhara do not having adequate education or training to find productive employment, they are left sitting at home feeling isolated, So by training them in weaving, sewing and dying techniques  to making high quality products gives these women a sense of empowerment to improve their own lives and those of their families. It also gives a positive aspect of giving women a sense of community rather than isolation.
Once trained, the women can work from their villages it enables them to take care of the family. Another great advantage of this, is that many are from a farming background and are needed in the fields during planting and harvesting times, this work gives them autonomy to choose their working hours. Not only does it help married women but single women who want an opportunity to have some independence in their lives.

## Women&apos;s Empowerment

Women&apos;s empowerment is a very important issue in Nepal. Historically women’s education was seen as unimportant as there role getting married, children and looking after the family home. This has changed in recent decades. Women themselves want to be educated and actively participate in providing for their family combined with having a career. Often it needs two incomes for the family to provide adequate education for their and sustain good health care provisions. HWSS address these issues in a productive way.


## Future Plans
Training programmes are set to be established in rural areas to eliminate the need for women to travel to the city for training. The goal is to train 500 women over the next 5 years and expand in to other areas of Nepal. The training programme is set to include all minority women.
