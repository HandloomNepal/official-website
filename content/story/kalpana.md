Kalpana’s story is not just a story of struggle but also a true love story. Kalpana and her husband originated in Chitwan, an area in southern Nepal. As they are both from different casts, neither of their families agreed to their marriage. This proved to be very difficult. In their first year of marriage they were blessed with a baby boy. Unfortunately, Kalana’s husband was unemployed, both families refused to help due to their marriage disagreement. 
With a 1 one year old they decided to move to Pokhara where her husband, after a few months, found work as a metal worker. As their son approached school age it was apparent that there was not enough income to pay school fees and she wanted to contribute to the family.

But when faced with the situation of her own child needing to be educated and couldn’t find productive work, she realised this importance. Now she is an expert weaver she is aspiring to become a weaver.
